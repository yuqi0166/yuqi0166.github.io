<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Currently I am an undergraduate student majoring in computer science in the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science,
  Peking University, minor in mathematics. <br /></p>
  
<p>My research interest is broadly situated in the intersection of computer science, mathematics and life science.
I would like to use mathematical-based and statistical-based principles to invent stronger computational tools to develop the field of life sciences and robotics.</p>
    
<p>Also, I have very strong interest for life science, apart from immunology, I am learning things about neuroscience, I wish that I could know how to do wet experiments
in my graduate studies! Meanwhile, I am learning quantum computing knowledge, too; it reminds me about the knowledge in general chemistry, I think I like it because I smell 
sence of natural sciences inside it.</p>
  
<p>In the future, I would like to continue to focus more on developing strong tools to solve problems in medical fields or robotics fields. And I want to set my goal in my
lifetime in discover stronger numerical methodologies to make it more useful to human health and life. </p>

    <p>The direction of the project, methodology and coding is mostly finished by me.. 
    </p>
    </li>
      
    <p>We made some attempts to build a more efficient vision transformer that is mathematically more efficient than other methodologies,
      but shares similar performance. A new kind of attention machanism has been proposed which is theoretically proved to closely get to the limit of theoretical lowerbound,
      yet the experiment performance is not as promising as expected.

        <p> The paper has been submitted to ECCV2022 and got rejected, we are preparing for CVPR2023 version. We design tools using statistical methodologies to calculate high-frequent activity patterns in egocentric videos, for example `pick up tomato and cook tomato', `open fridge and close fridge', and use them to 
        extract more effective vision representations to guide high-level planning of intelligent robots. The ECCV version only contains the extraction of vision prior, and currently it is being revised and implemented to guide the high-level planning of robotics, and 
        a new dataset on simulator has been built.</p>
        <p> The work that I have been done in the work of ECCV2022 includes the design of statistical method to calculate activity patterns, the generation of graph, including the paper-writing. </p>
        <p> The work that I am doing in the work of CVPR2023 includes the dataset design and collection (which contains 1200 videos), all of the labeing work(done by my code), the generation of graph, the new robotic planning task.</p>
