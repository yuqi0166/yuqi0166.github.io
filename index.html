<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Currently I am an undergraduate student majoring in computer science in the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science,
  Peking University, minor in mathematics. <br /></p>
  
<p>My research interest is broadly situated in the intersection of computer science, mathematics and life science.
I would like to use mathematical-based and statistical-based principles to invent stronger computational tools to develop the field of life sciences and robotics.</p>
    
<p>Also, I have very strong interest for life science, apart from immunology, I am learning things about neuroscience, I wish that I could know how to do wet experiments
in my graduate studies! Meanwhile, I am learning quantum computing knowledge, too; it reminds me about the knowledge in general chemistry, I think I like it because I smell 
sence of natural sciences inside it.</p>
  
<p>In the future, I would like to continue to focus more on developing strong tools to solve problems in medical fields or robotics fields. And I want to set my goal in my
lifetime in discover stronger numerical methodologies to make it more useful to human health and life. </p>

<h2>Research Experiences</h2>
  
 <p>To be more specific, the tools that I have tried to invent include:</p>
<p>a) a more efficient vision transformer that is mathematically more efficient than other methodologies, but shares similar performance</p>
<p>b) a tools using statistical methodologies to calculate high-frequent occasions of activities in egocentric videos, and is used to extract more effective vision
representations to guide high-level planning of intelligent robots </p>
<p>c) a machine-learning based tools to predict more precise locations of amino acids of antibody structure, is used to achieve antibody structure prediction and
improve antibody-antigen binding capacity.</p>

    <p>We made some attempts to improve existing algorithms for the supersingular isogeny problem using techniques in quantum walk,
         but failed due to the special structure of the problem. I wrote a survey about this problem, pointed out the hardness of the 
         problem and explained why we failed.

        <p>
            I am going to hold a seminar on physics and computation, discussing the connection between them, going beyond the fundemantal 
            connection established by quantum computing.
