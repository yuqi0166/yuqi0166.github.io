<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Currently I am an undergraduate student in the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University.
    I major in computer science, and minor in mathematics.<br /></p>
<p>My research interests are situated in quantum computing and quantum information. More precisely, I am interested in investigating mathematical structure 
of problems, and applying techniques from TCS (such as complexity theory) and math (such as representation theory) to solve problems 
in quantum computing. I have been doing research on quantum alogorithm for algebraic problems, such as supersingular isogeny problem 
(the intractability of which has been the basis of a post-quantum crypto protocol SIKE.) and hidden subgroup problem (HSP). I am studying the 
non-locality and the quantum interactive proof as well, because the structure behind it is quite attractive. I am also interested in 
using theory in math and physics (such as category theory) to develop and discribe theories in quantum computing and quantum information.   </p>

<h2>Research Experiences</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p> Quantum Algorithms For Supersingular Isogeny Problems. <a href="pdf/isogeny.pdf"> [pdf] </a> 
     advised by <a href="https://www.tongyangli.com/">Tongyang Li.</a> </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Talk on <i>Learning by Research</i> <a href="pdf/LBR.pdf"> [slides] </a>. 2022.06.02 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We made some attempts to improve existing algorithms for the supersingular isogeny problem using techniques in quantum walk,
         but failed due to the special structure of the problem. I wrote a survey about this problem, pointed out the hardness of the 
         problem and explained why we failed.

<h2>Seminar</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="seminar.html">Seminar on Physics and Computation</a> <a href="pdf/Syllabus.pdf">[Syllabus]</a>  [2022 Winter]  <br />
        <p>
            I am going to hold a seminar on physics and computation, discussing the connection between them, going beyond the fundemantal 
            connection established by quantum computing.
